This is an old fork of mongo-mock kept just cause. Basically mongo-mock didn't support some features I needed - namely lt, gt, gte, lte, etc - so I wrote a quick and dirty way to add the features.

This prompted a discussion with the author of mongo-mock who found another module that made adding the features into all of mongo-mock much simpler, and it was done + pushed. So this is out of date and less feature-filled, but kept for prosperity or giggles or something.
